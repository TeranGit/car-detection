# Real-Time Car Detection using OpenCV and Python With Source Code

### Overview
The Real-Time Car Detection OpenCV Python project was developed using Python and OpenCV. Vehicle detection is a widely used feature by companies and organizations these days. This technology uses computer vision to detect different types of vehicles in a video or real-time via a camera.

A Car Detection OpenCV Python project finds its applications in traffic control, car tracking, creating parking sensors, and many more. In this project, we will learn how to build a car tracking system in Python for both recorded and live cam streamed videos.
